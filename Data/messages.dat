There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger."ãTo support its bulb, Ivysaur's legs grow sturdy. If it spends more time lying in the sunlight, the bud will soon bloom into a large flower."ëVenusaur's flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people."óThe flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is happy, and blazes when it is enraged."ùWithout pity, its sharp claws destroy foes. If it encounters a strong enemy, it becomes agitated, and the flame on its tail flares with a bluish white color."òA Charizard flies about in search of strong opponents. It breathes intense flames that can melt any material. However, it will never torch a weaker foe."ûIts shell is not just for protection. Its rounded shape and the grooves on its surface minimize resistance in water, enabling Squirtle to swim at high speeds."ûIts large tail is covered with rich, thick fur that deepens in color with age. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pok√©mon's toughness in battle."ñThe waterspouts that protrude from its shell are highly accurate. Their bullets of water can precisely nail tin cans from a distance of over 160 feet."èIts voracious appetite compels it to devour leaves bigger than itself without hesitation. It releases a terribly strong odor from its antennae."êIts shell is as hard as an iron slab. A Metapod does not move very much because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the shell."ñIt has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can seek, extract, and carry honey from flowers blooming over six miles away."£A Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It distinguishes its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose)."¢It remains virtually immobile while it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it busily prepares for evolution. This is evident from how hot its shell becomes."áA Beedrill is extremely territorial. For safety reasons, no one should ever approach its nest. If angered, they will attack in a swarm."ñIt has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It can unerringly return home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."§This Pok√©mon flies around, patrolling its large territory. If its living space is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws."òPidgeot has gorgeous, glossy feathers. Many trainers are so captivated by the beautiful feathers on its head that they choose Pidgeot as their Pok√©mon."ìA Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly moves its ears and listens for danger. It will make its nest anywhere."áA Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses."üIts loud cry can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger."ãIts long neck and elongated beak are ideal for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves this extended and skinny beak to pluck prey."§An Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. This position allows it to quickly respond to an enemy from any direction with a threat from its upraised head."üThis Pok√©mon has a terrifically strong constricting power. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once it wraps its body around its foe, escaping is impossible."ñIt stores electricity in the electric sacs on its cheeks.
